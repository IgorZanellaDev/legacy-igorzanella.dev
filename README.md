This is my portfolio website. I am a Freelance Web Developer and Social Media Manager.

## Sapper/Svelte
For this project I used Sapper, which is a Svelte framework for SPA. I think it is a powerful framework, but as of today (Sempteber 2020) the community is not so big and there are not so many libraries.
\
I think I will re-use it in the future, but not for important projects.

## Tailwind CSS
I use Tailwind CSS for graphics part, it is not like Bootstrap, Bulma, etc, because it does not have a default theme or predesigned components.
\
It is composed by a lot of low-level CSS classes which let you concentrate only HTML without writing CSS (or so, I wrote about 3-4 lines in the whole project).
\
It is good for little projects and simple styles, but I think it creates a bit of confusion on HTML. This is a personal opinion, there is not accounting for taste.
