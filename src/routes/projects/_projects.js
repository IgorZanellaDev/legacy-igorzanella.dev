			<h2 class="text-light text-xl font-title">What is BestOnDesk?</h2>
			<p class="text-light">
				BestOnDesk is a business I started a friend of mine, Marco Campagnolo.
				<br/>We wanted to create a website for all the people which work in the offices, to help them with articles on personal growth. The website is also for companies advices.

			<h2 class="text-light text-xl font-title">What did I do?</h2>
			<p class="text-light">
				I created the website on Wordpress CMS using a prepackaged theme (I didn't have so much time because I was working as employee).
				<br/>The website is hosted on Amazon Web Services EC2 server, with OpenLiteSpeed web server. I used CloudFlare CDN.
				<br/>I planned to transform the frontend to headless CMS, so I will recreate the new frontend using a JS framework like React or Svelte.
