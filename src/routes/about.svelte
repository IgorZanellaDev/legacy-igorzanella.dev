		<h1 class="text-3xl font-title font-bold md:hidden">About <span class="text-primary">me</span></h1>
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-title font-bold">Who <span class="text-primary">am I</span>?</h2>
		<p>Hi, I am Igor, I am Italian and {age} years old (yes, it's changing dynamically, you can check it on 2nd FebruaryðŸ˜‰). I love IT world, so I decided to become a freelancer, after more than 3 years as employee.</p>
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-title font-bold mt-3 leading-tight">What are my previous <span class="text-primary">work experiences</span>?</h2>
		<p>I worked in 3 different branches of IT, I worked in IT security for some months, but it was shift work, also on weekends and it was not compatible with my other activities.</p>
		<p class="mt-2">Then, I worked as web developer, but I did not like the environment of the company where i was. I developed on web apps using Angular JS and Ionic, following directly entirely projects on my own.</p>
		<p class="mt-2">The last job I did as employee was the IT consultant, so I worked on hardware and virtual environments in companies. From virtual machines to network and security. And I learnt how to behave in companies.</p>
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-title font-bold mt-3 leading-tight">Why I decided to became a <span class="text-primary">freelancer</span>?</h2>
		<p>I have an affiliate marketing web business (<a href="/projects/bestondesk" class="text-accent underline">BestOnDesk</a>), I had to open a VAT account to manage entrances and exits. So I decided to become a freelancer also for web developing and social media management.</p>
		<p class="mt-2">I decided it on my previous and actual projects I'm managing. My goal is to live with entrances from my businesses, but I love coding, so I want also to continue to develop my passion.</p>
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-title font-bold mt-3 leading-tight">Where did I learn to <span class="text-primary">code</span>?</h2>
		<p>I learn basics at high school, I did 5 years, oriented to "IT and telecommunications", where I achieve advanced skills on some object-oriented programming languages like Java and C++.</p>
		<p class="mt-2">I also studied at home, and I did some projects on my own or with friends, like mobile games on Unity 3D.</p>
		<p class="mt-2">After school I decided not go to university, for various reasons, mainly because in the first period I should have to study things that I already know or I don't like.</p>
		<p class="mt-2">I continued to study at home, I love web developing and I'm always studying new programming languages and frameworks.</p>
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-title font-bold mt-3 leading-tight">Where did I learn things about <span class="text-primary">Social Media</span>?</h2>
		<p>I learnt it "on the job" and on web articles and blogs. I now manage different social accounts with good  (like <a href="/projects/racing-line-motorsport" class="text-accent underline">Racing Line Motorsport</a>, <a href="/projects/bestondesk" class="text-accent underline">BestOnDesk</a>, <a href="/projects/igorzanella16" class="text-accent underline">Igor Zanella #16</a>) with good results.</p>
		<p class="mt-2">I like to work on socials because they offer a possibility to let you became known in the whole world.</p>
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-title font-bold mt-3 leading-tight">What are my other <span class="text-primary">passions</span>?</h2>
		<p>As you can see on my projects I love adrenaline sports, motorsports in particular. In my spare time I train in martial arts (MMA and BJJ), I go snowboarding, enduro mountain biking, karting.</p>
		<p class="mt-2">Follow me on my social if you are interested in this things!</p>
