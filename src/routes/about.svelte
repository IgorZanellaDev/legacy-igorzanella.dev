		<h1 class="text-3xl font-title font-bold md:hidden">About <span class="text-primary">me</span></h1>
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-title font-bold">Who <span class="text-primary">am I</span>?</h2>
		<p>Hi, I am Igor, I am Italian and {age} years old (yes, it is changing dynamically, you can check it on 2nd FebruaryðŸ˜‰). I love IT world, so I decided to become a freelancer, after more than 3 years as an employee.</p>
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-title font-bold mt-3 leading-tight">What are my previous <span class="text-primary">work experiences</span>?</h2>
		<p>I worked in 3 different areas of IT, I have worked in IT security for a few months, but it was shift work, also on weekends and it was not compatible with my other activities.</p>
		<p class="mt-2">Then, I worked as a web developer, but I did not like the environment of the company where I was. I developed on web apps using Angular JS and Ionic, following directly entirely projects by myself.</p>
		<p class="mt-2">The last job I did as an employee was the IT consultant, so I worked on hardware and virtual environments in companies. From virtual machines to network and security. And I learnt how to behave in companies as customers.</p>
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-title font-bold mt-3 leading-tight">Why did I decide to become a <span class="text-primary">freelancer</span>?</h2>
		<p>I have an affiliate marketing web business (<a href="/projects/bestondesk" class="text-accent underline">BestOnDesk</a>), I had to open a VAT account to manage entrances and exits. So I decided to become a freelancer also for web development and social media management.</p>
		<p class="mt-2">I decided it on my previous and actual projects I'm managing. My goal is to live with entrances from my businesses, but I love coding, so I want also to continue to develop my passion.</p>
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-title font-bold mt-3 leading-tight">Where did I learn to <span class="text-primary">code</span>?</h2>
		<p>I learnt basics in high school, I have spent 5 years, oriented to "IT and telecommunications", where I achieved advanced skills on some object-oriented programming languages like Java and C++. But also on web development like HTML, CSS, etc..</p>
		<p class="mt-2">I also studied at home, and I did some projects by myself or with friends, such as mobile games on Unity 3D.</p>
		<p class="mt-2">After school I decided not go to university, for various reasons, mainly because in the first period I would have studied things that I already knew or I did not like.</p>
		<p class="mt-2">I continued to study at home, I love web developing and I'm always studying new programming languages and frameworks.</p>
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-title font-bold mt-3 leading-tight">Where did I learn things about <span class="text-primary">Social Media</span>?</h2>
		<p>I learnt it "on the job" and on web articles and blogs. I now manage different social accounts (like <a href="/projects/racing-line-motorsport" class="text-accent underline">Racing Line Motorsport</a>, <a href="/projects/bestondesk" class="text-accent underline">BestOnDesk</a>, <a href="/projects/igorzanella16" class="text-accent underline">Igor Zanella #16</a>) with good results.</p>
		<p class="mt-2">I like to work on socials because they offer a possibility to make you known throughout the world.</p>
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-title font-bold mt-3 leading-tight">What are my other <span class="text-primary">passions</span>?</h2>
		<p>As you can see on my projects I love adrenaline sports, Motorsports in particular. In my spare time I train in martial arts (MMA and BJJ), I go snowboarding, Enduro mountain biking, Karting.</p>
		<p class="mt-2">Follow me on my social if you are interested in these things!</p>
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-title font-bold mt-3 leading-tight">Let's <span class="text-primary">talk</span>!</h2>
		<p>We can talk on the chat you can find in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. Or you can contact me by mail at <a href="mailto:hello@igorzanella.dev" class="text-accent underline">hello@igorzanella.dev</a>. I'm waiting for you!</p>
